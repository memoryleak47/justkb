XChangeKeyboardMapping() seems to need XCloseDisplay() to work

XCloseDisplay() does an XSync(), but adding XSync(d, True) OR XSync(d, False), doesn't help..
XFlush(d) also doesn't help

XFlush() and XSync instead of flush(), don't flush the buffer
	I see because I have to type 4 keys => 8 events to receive an automatic SYN-event,
	so maybe I used them wrong
